It makes sure the pictures are in a good shape for the computer to understand.
It builds a special kind of program called a neural network that learns from these pictures.
It gets this program ready to learn by setting up some rules.
It teaches the program using the pictures, making it a little smarter each time.
It checks how well the program learned.
It draws a picture to show how well the program did in learning over time.
